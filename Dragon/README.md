This project can be said to be the culmination of all my Processing knowledge, which of course isn't much. But all the small programs I made in one way or the other helped in creating this.

PS: To me, this project holds some sentimental value. This was a game I made for a college assignment. Is it a really impressive project worth showing off? Probably not. But for an assignment, you could say I went above and beyond. Each room incorporates ideas and programs my peers made, and I wanted it to showcase everyone's creativity.\
Cheers!
