# Mini Processing Stuff
 
Before i incorporate modules in programs i make small standalone version of them, and these are them.


<li>elseif - Testing Else if, But i am keeping it because its a cool concept i will incorporate later in the future
<li>mydino - What my character was based on, made purely on processing and also my first assignment
<li>Radvio - My attempt at learning pixel manipulation, Logo belongs to my music producer friend
<li>Soundweave - Testing my incorporation of mic in my big dragon game
<li>Taxi - A cool way to learn about functions and arguments in processing
<li>Wacom - Testing brush strokes, again kept to polish a concept
