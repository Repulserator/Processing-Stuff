## A replica of Boxhead
 
The first file is my attempt at creating a 2 player game.\ 
However for the sake of bias and practicality i very much wanted to create it for lan, so its playable across multiple devices.
So hence the 2nd file. I was able to establish a connection and replicate actions.\
No plans to develop it further.

I made this because i loved that old game and it was my way of learning processing
